## The snackbot sqlite database

The snackbot database resides in "./database/snackbot.db"

### Creating the "Snacks" table

The "db-setup.js" and "snacks.csv" files in this directory can be used to set up an example sqlite database with a populated "Snacks" table. The sample data in "snacks.csv" was pulled from a [list of snack foods on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_snack_foods). This table is necessary to properly run the discord "snacks" command.
